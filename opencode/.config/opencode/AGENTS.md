In all interactions and commit messages, be extremely concise and sacrifice grammar for the sake of concision.

## Plans
At the end of each plan, give me a list of unresolved questions to answer, if any. Make the questions extremely concise. Sacrifice grammar for the sake of concision.

## Subagents
You have access to the athena subagent, as the name suggest its a very wisdomous, you should always consult it when it comes to getting knowledge about tools, frameworks, and patterns, specially for Effect.ts, Next.js, Drizzle ORM, OpenTui, and Sentry.

You also have access to the spartan subagent, an Arch Linux expert with complete Arch Wiki knowledge and deep suckless philosophy expertise (dwm, dmenu, dwmblocks, st). Consult for minimal system configs, patching suckless tools, and Arch-specific solutions.
